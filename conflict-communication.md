##Conflict Resolution
* We have agreed that when a disagreement occurs, we will take 10 minutes per side for discussion.  We will then vote on a scale of 1-6 so as 1 is strongly for, and 6 strongly aginst.  In this manner we will be able to see in which way the team is leaning.

* In the case of a tie,  we will seek professional advice from an instructor or teaching assistant.

* Our work flow will dictate that all memebers will be present durring standups in which individual work level evaluations will be brought up if neccessary.

## Communication Plan
* We plan on sitting together during work hours  (approx 9:00 to 5:00).

* In the case that work is done after work hours, we plan on using Slack to communicate.

* During daily stand-ups we will go around in a circle to make sure all voices are heard.
